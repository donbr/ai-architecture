These capabilities are transforming various areas of healthcare, including diagnostic imaging, clinical decision support, patient monitoring, and treatment planning.

According to a press release from the FDA in January 2025, "The FDA has authorized more than 1,000 AI-enabled devices through established premarket pathways" [1]. This rapid growth reflects the increasing recognition of AI's potential to enhance healthcare delivery and improve patient outcomes. In 2023 alone, the FDA approved a record 221 AI-powered medical devices, and in the first half of 2024, an additional 107 were approved [2].

However, this growth also brings significant challenges. AI-enabled medical devices must navigate complex regulatory frameworks, ensure data privacy and security, address ethical concerns, and maintain clinical effectiveness throughout their lifecycle. These challenges require specialized expertise in AI architecture, regulatory compliance, and healthcare integration.

The AI Architect role has emerged as a critical position within medical device companies, responsible for defining and implementing AI architecture, integrating models with enterprise systems, and ensuring regulatory compliance. This report explores the key aspects of this role, the challenges it addresses, and the strategies for successful implementation of AI in medical devices.

## 2. Regulatory Landscape for AI in Medical Devices

### 2.1 FDA Regulatory Framework

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been actively developing a regulatory framework to address the unique challenges posed by AI and machine learning in medical devices. The FDA's approach recognizes that AI-enabled medical devices differ from traditional medical devices in their ability to learn and evolve over time, presenting novel regulatory challenges.

In January 2021, the FDA published the "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Software as a Medical Device Action Plan" (AI/ML SaMD Action Plan), followed by guidance documents addressing various aspects of AI regulation [3]. Most recently, on January 6, 2025, the FDA published the Draft Guidance: "Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Device Software Functions: Lifecycle Management and Marketing Submission Recommendations" [4]. This draft guidance proposes both lifecycle considerations and specific recommendations to support marketing submissions for AI-enabled medical devices, with a comment period open until April 7, 2025 [5].

The January 2025 guidance is intended to be "the first guidance to provide comprehensive recommendations for AI-enabled devices throughout the total product lifecycle, providing developers an accessible set of considerations that tie together design, development, maintenance and documentation recommendations to help ensure safety and effectiveness of AI-enabled devices" [1]. This guidance complements the previously issued final guidance on predetermined change control plans for AI-enabled devices, which provides recommendations on how to proactively plan for device updates once the product is on the market.

According to the Federal Register notice, the draft guidance "proposes recommendations for the design, development, and implementation of AI-enabled devices that sponsors may wish to consider using throughout the total product lifecycle (TPLC)" [6]. The FDA is specifically requesting public comment on several aspects, including:

- The draft guidance's alignment with the AI lifecycle
- The adequacy of the recommendations to address concerns raised by emerging technology such as generative AI
- The approach to performance monitoring
- The type of information about AI-enabled devices that should be conveyed to users and the most appropriate approach to deliver that information [1]

### 2.2 AI Lifecycle Management

The FDA's regulatory approach increasingly focuses on AI Lifecycle Management (AILC) as a framework for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of AI-enabled medical devices throughout their lifecycle. In July 2024, the FDA's Digital Health Center of Excellence (DHCoE) published a blog post outlining a lifecycle management approach for AI-enabled healthcare [7].

The AILC model extends traditional Software Development Lifecycles (SDLCs) to address the unique characteristics of AI, particularly its ability to learn and adapt in real-world settings. The FDA's model presents the AI lifecycle as a wheel with seven stages:

1. **Planning and Design**: Problem definition, data collection planning, algorithm selection, and model design
2. **Data Collection and Management**: Data suitability, quality assurance, privacy and security, governance
3. **Model Building and Tuning**: Model selection, hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, validation
4. **Verification and Validation**: Evaluation metrics, data verification, validation strategies, documentation
5. **Model Deployment**: Scalability, integration, monitoring and logging, compliance
6. **Operations and Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring, alerting, performance optimization, drift detection
7. **Real-world Performance Evaluation**: KPI definition, production data collection, feedback collection, continuous improvement [8]

The FDA sees this model as "a playbook for helping to assess standards and a launchpad for other projects, such as the development of a checklist for the systematic creation and evaluation of AI" [7]. According to the DHCoE, "Standards play a role in the AILC by helping to ensure quality, facilitate interoperability, and promote ethical practices. They also help guide development, enhance transparency, support compliance, encourage innovation, and build trust" [9].

### 2.3 Predetermined Change Control Plans

One crucial component of the FDA's approach to AI/ML-enabled medical devices is the concept of Predetermined Change Control Plans (PCCPs). PCCPs provide a framework for making iterative improvements to AI algorithms while maintaining regulatory compliance.

In December 2024, the FDA finalized recommendations for streamlining the approval process for medical devices that use artificial intelligence. According to the American Hospital Association, "The guidance recommends information to include in a predetermined change control plan as part of a marketing submission for a medical device using AI. The PCCP should include a description of the device's planned modifications; methods to develop, validate and implement the modifications; and an assessment of the modification's impacts" [10].

The Veranex guide on navigating FDA's latest guidance (January 2025) explains that PCCPs are designed to support iterative improvements in software and simplify regulatory processes. According to the guide, a PCCP must include:

1. **Description of Planned Modifications**: Details of the changes anticipated for the AI model
2. **Performance Evaluation Protocols**: Predefined acceptance criteria and methods for verifying and validating modifications
3. **Impact Assessment**: Analysis of potential benefits and risks associated with implementing post-approval modifications and plans to mitigate risks [11]

This approach allows manufacturers to update their AI models within predefined parameters without requiring new regulatory submissions for each update, addressing one of the key challenges of regulating adaptive AI systems.
